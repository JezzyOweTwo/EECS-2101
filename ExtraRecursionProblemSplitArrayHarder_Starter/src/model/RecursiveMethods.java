	 * A useful extension to the original `splitArray` problem.
	 * 
	 * If a split of equal sums is possible, return an ArrayList of size 2: 
	 * 	- index 1 of the returned ArrayList stores the list of integers representing group 1.
	 * 	- index 0 of the returned ArrayList stores the list of integers representing group 1.
	 * 
	 * If a split is not possible, both indices store empty lists.
	 * 
	 * Requirements (as an example, see `testSplitArrayHarder_14` in RecursiveMethodTests): 
	 * 	When an equal split is possible, then:
	 * 		+ The first element of the input array `ns` (i.e., ns[0]) must be put into group1.
	 * 		+ The order in which elements appear in each group must be the same as they appear in the input array `ns`.
	 * 
	 * Assumption: when a split is possible, there is a single, unique split only.
	 * 
	 * Hints:
	 * 		+ Pass as arguments two empty lists, representing group1 and group2, to the call to a recursive helper method.
	 * 		+ Via call by value, the two lists should be modified properly among as the recursion tree is built.
	 * 		+ Upon the call terminating, return a list containing the two modified lists.
